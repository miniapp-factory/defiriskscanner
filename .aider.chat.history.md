Please add the following file to the chat so I can propose the necessary edits:

```
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
```

I will also create a new file for the logo generation:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once you add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating the title and description, and I will supply the content for `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.
